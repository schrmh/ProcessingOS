# ProcessingOS
TODO:
- Create a WM like experience (create, close & redraw windows based on 
position)
- Save drawings as objects (so that they don't destroy/conflict with 
other drawed windows. Note to myself: look at the shapes BGI 
thing..)
- Make a global menu bar (to make it easier to launch windows; add 
minimize)
- Special windows like a task manager (list drawings and destroy them 
with a click of their entry)
- Include a Total Launcher like editing mode (e.g. resize global menu 
bar, add buttons to it or you want to split it like described in the 
next TODO and save that without having to modify code)
- Make it possible to snip,cut&paste windows and their content (e.g. you 
want to cut a window in half because why not not or you want to cut out 
something square sized from a window and delete it or move it to 
another position)
- Make it possible to communicate with other instances running on other 
devices (Demonstrate with text messaging app)
- Include a multiuser/multiinstance paint app (mirror window to second 
instance, so that two users can draw at the same time; first person can 
close it for both, second can only close the mirror)
- Get inspired by clusters (use the resources of two devices)
- Get lazy
